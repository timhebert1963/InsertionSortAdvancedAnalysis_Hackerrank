Hankerrank documentation for Insertion Sort Advanced Analysis
https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/insertion-sort/problem

the requirement is to count and return the shifts/inversions it would take to sort the array
and not necessarily end up with a sorted array. 
 - the program does not have to return the sorted array.
 
 Some tests to pass on Hackerrank for Insertion Sort Advanced Analysis inlcuded as a demo in main().
 
 TC2_1_length_441_answer_46768.py and TC2_2_length_18_answer_77.py need to be imported in teh main() for loop. 
  - Refer to main() for an example.
